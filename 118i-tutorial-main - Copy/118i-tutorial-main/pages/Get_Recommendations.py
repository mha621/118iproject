                    10,000 steps or walking a mile. Walk-E is also connected with local businesses\
                        and can point users towards these mom-and-pop shops to increase foot traffic\
                            while encouraging people to walk more. You also provide people who take up these walking challenges\
                            with rewards such as coupons or deals for these businesses. Keep in mind that \
