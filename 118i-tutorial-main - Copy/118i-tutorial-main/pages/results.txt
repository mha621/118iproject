Summary:
The Sapphire Team's project, Walk-E, aims to address the challenges faced by users like Bob, a college student without a car who seeks safe walking routes and urban improvements. Bob interacts with Walk-E by using its features to address community needs, gather data, and propose urban planning solutions. The prototype focuses on making Downtown San Jose more walkable through features like speech-to-text analysis, generative AI for renderings, and a reward system for walking challenges. The project's GitHub link provides access to the prototype showcasing these functionalities.
